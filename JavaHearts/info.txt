Console Hearts:


This was a project I worked on to try and release on the Android. I started off by getting hearts to work within the core of java and making it text based. 
The game should play (4 AI's taht randomly choose a card). With few errors , and then print out the results. 

That is as far as this project got. I got distracted with family life and work life issues and by the time I came back to it
the group I was making it for had moved on and thought this project was past its possible prime. 



Disclaimer: The code is poorly organized and horribly commented. I am use to working alone and have not mastered the skill of comments and clean code.
When I have time I plan to go back through all my code and comment it and clean it up as much as possible.
