Tanks was a attempt at a multiplayer tank game my cousin and his colleague were making. We found at the time we didn't have the time or the proper team size to take on a project this big. but we did get some fair progress and I learned a lot. I wrote all the client network code for this project. I also did some work on the server but I did not do enough of the code to post any of it here.
