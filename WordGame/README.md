for kids to play and hopefully learn words and spelling. I made this game to show my kids what I do and to build on the knowlege <br><br>

You can play the game at http://www.ericranaldi.com/test/index.html . The game is built using the WebGL technology of Unity3D and is in a alpha.beta phase. It will not work in IE and I have seen some issues in Firefox. It uses a lot of ram but once loaded is pretty stable. This is just for a preivew of the game so you dont have to install Unity on your machine to run it and you don't have to download a executable.

If you do want to download a executable the rar is avaliable at http://www.ericranaldi.com/files/wordgame.rar
