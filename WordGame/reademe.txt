WordGame:

Wordgame has been developed using Unity3D game engine. It is a simple word solving game for kids. It is designed to be simple
for kids to play and hopefully learn words and spelling. I made this game to show my kids what I do and to build on the knowlege 
I have gained overed the years. 

Game Features:
-Simple UI based gameplay
-High score list
-Ability to quickly add new word challenges to the game.
-Multiplatform - Has a PC and webplayer build. possibly going to add iOS and Android builds
