Code samples from my different projects.

Marketmaker:
  This was a projject I worked for a new startup. I was responsible for writing the server backend system. The game was a browser game that needed to keep a live connection. So part of my server system was a node.js middle-man server that converted and passed message between the client and the game logic server.
