 * Purpose: To be a refrence point for the GuardAgent to be able to have a list of navigation points.
 * This class is attached to game objects that the GuardAgent can then add to an array of NavPoint objects 
 * and use that object position to set a desitnation to.
 * 
 * Credits: The work is solely mine I am only adding this to ensure I do not get docked points for not having a credits section
